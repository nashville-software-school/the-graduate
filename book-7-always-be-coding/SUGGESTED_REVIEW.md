# Suggested Review Materials

It's important to keep your coding skills sharp - we covered *a lot* in a short amount of time! We recommend you deepen your knowledge of what you learned here at NSS; focusing on the languages you are already familiar with. With that in mind, here are a few ideas of how you can broaden your development skills and keep your Github activity active.

1. Remember Bangazon? That last sprint has many tickets that your teams likely didn't complete. Fork your team's repo and work your way through those remaining tickets. 
2. Revist your client side or server side capstones. Many students have stretch goals that they didn't have time to complete by demo day; now is a great time to build those stretch features!
3. Create a new project (ideally in a language you learned at NSS). Did you do a web app for your server side? Give an API a try (vice versa if you created an API for your server side). Build another front end app using vanilla javascript or React (and maybe even connect it to an API you build or to a [3rd party API](https://github.com/toddmotto/public-apis)). [Here's a list](https://medium.freecodecamp.org/the-secret-to-being-a-top-developer-is-building-things-heres-a-list-of-fun-apps-to-build-aac61ac0736c) of fun apps you could build if you're short on ideas.
4. Build a backend for your frontend capstone.
5. There were many resources (videos, articles) in both the client side and server side that you may not have visited (or would like to revisit). Review those resources and complete any of the exercises you didn't do while in the course.

6. Create or update your project README's. Here's a README inspector you could check out: https://www.npmjs.com/package/readme-inspector.
